# What is FormoJS? #

FormoJS is a Kohana module which adds live validation feedback to forms built with [Formo](http://github.com/bmidget/kohana-formo) through Javascript and asynchronous requests.

# What FormoJS is not # 

FormoJS is not a replacement for server-side Formo validation. While it is possible to do validation in javascript on the client side, the nature of the web is such that client-side validation should never be relied upon.

## Requirements of FormoJS ##

1. Formo
2. Kohana
2. Mootools or jQuery
